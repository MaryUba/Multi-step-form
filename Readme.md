### Multi Step Form
This is a form with four steps that allows users to provide their details and choose subscription plans they want from options. At the last step of the form, all the subscriptions the users entered in the previous steps would be calculated and the total would be shown in the last page for confirmation. If users accept, they would be met with a congratulatory message thanking them for subscriing.
At any step users can click the "back" button to go back to the previous step.
